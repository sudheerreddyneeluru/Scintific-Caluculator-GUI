 # Introduction :
Let’s create a GUI-based Scientific Calculator that accepts all the math operations including lag & trigonometric when the user enters the value and enters the “button”, he will get the respective output.
The scientific Calculator works similarly to the normal calculator but with some added functionalities. 

# Outline:
In this project, we will take one, two, or more values(operands) as input from the user and operate with the help of operators and produce the output. 
We just write our python script in any text editor or IDE and run it. After running the script a new window will appear with GUI(Graphical User Interface), we can enter any values and get the output accordingly.

# Project Prerequisites:
You don’t have to install any package in your system to run this script. Because we create our own GUI with the help of tkinter.Tkinter is automatically provided by a python while installing.
tkinter: The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.
It runs on the following:
Linux
Windows
macOS
Supported Python versions are 2.7, 3.4+
for more information about this library refer to this – tkinter — Python interface to Tcl/Tk — Python 3.10.5 documentation
 That’s it…! We just don’t need to install any other package for this project.

 run the python script like the above-given command.
After running the source code, a new window will appear like the following:

After running the above-given command, according to the given input, the corresponding operation is performed and the result will be displayed.
You can switch between standard and scientific calculator by pressing on the file button on the top left corner. 
you can see how to switch below image

After switching to the scientific calculator, the output will be displayed like this:

You can play with the calculator at your own wish.
I hope this project helped you in making a scientific calculator on your own…
# Important Note:
Note that you can still improve this GUI and make it even better by changing its properties.
Go to the documentation of the Tkinter, learn about it, and start playing with it.
